The league passed the three-quarter mark of the season last week, and we're past time for the teams in playoff races to get serious and teams on their way to the Lottery to coast to the finish.
But the last seven days were a week of parity, with 29 of the 30 teams (the Kings were the one exception) winning at least one game and 28 of the 30 (all except the Rockets and Jazz) losing at least once. Three of the top five teams in last week's rankings -- Golden State, Denver and Oklahoma City -- lost two games or more.
The 18-46 Chicago Bulls have won the last five games that Otto Porter Jr. has played in, while the 16-48 Cleveland Cavaliers have won five of the last six that they've played with Kevin Love. The bottom four teams in the West all played spoiler last week, winning at least one game against a team in playoff position or still fighting for a playoff spot.
You can look at remaining schedules and project how teams will do over the final six weeks of the season, but nothing is guaranteed.
